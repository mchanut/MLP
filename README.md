# Background

This project is the second assignment of COMP551 : Applied Machine Learning taught by Professor Isabeau Pr√©mont-Schwarz in Fall 2023 at McGill University.

In this miniproject, we will implement a multilayer perceptron from scratch, and use it to classify image data. One of the goals is to implement a basic neural network and its training algorithm from scratch and get hands-on experience with important decisions that you have to make while training these models. We will also have a chance to experiment with convolutional neural networks and use pre-trained versions of them to perform image classification.
